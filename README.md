# CSE1322L-in-Kotlin
CSE1322L Assignments and Labs done in Kotlin.

This is just personal practice with learning Kotlin using Kennesaw State University's coursework for CSE1322L. Not all of the assignments and labs will be completed.

Public repository is for KSU students who are also learning Kotlin and would like to compare their code.

CSE1322L coursework can be found here: https://www.kennesaw.edu/ccse/first-year-experience/cse-1322-lab.php

Note that this repository uses instructions from Fall 2024 semester, and as such may not be applicable in the future.
